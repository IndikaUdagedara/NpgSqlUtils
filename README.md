# npgsqlutils

## Some utils for Npgsql

- Simple wrapper to run inline sql without setting up connections, commands, parameters etc. and use scalar and table-valued parameters. 
- Postgres doesn't have tvp - they are mimicked by arrays of regular or Composite types
- See the sample program for usage

NOT a complete project at all - use with care. You've been warned.
